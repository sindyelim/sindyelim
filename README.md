### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Sindy, an aspiring technical writer. This past summer, I completed a technical writing portfolio workshop that involved learning GitHub and creating technical documentation for it. The experience deepened my interest in technical writing. I hope to become a documentarian that translates complex material into digestible content and inspires confidence in the user.

Aside from technical documentation, you can catch me geeking out on film photography, Phoebe Bridgers, and books.
