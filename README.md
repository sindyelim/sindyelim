### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Sindy, an aspiring technical writer. I'm currently taking a portfolio workshop class that involves learning GitHub. By the end of the class, I hope to have four technical documents about GitHub to add to my portfolio.

Aside from technical documentation, you can catch me geeking out on film photography, Phoebe Bridgers, and books.
